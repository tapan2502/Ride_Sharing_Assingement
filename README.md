# RideShare - Full-Stack Ride-Sharing Application

## Project Overview

RideShare is a comprehensive full-stack ride-sharing application built with modern web technologies. It provides a platform for users to book rides, drivers to accept and complete rides, and administrators to oversee the entire system. This project showcases proficiency in full-stack development, real-time features, and complex state management.

## Key Features

- User, Driver, and Admin roles with distinct functionalities
- Real-time ride booking and tracking
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Interactive maps for ride visualization
- Payment processing (simulated)
- Ride history and analytics
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React.js
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- Material-UI for responsive design
- Leaflet for interactive maps
- Socket.io client for real-time updates

### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- MongoDB for database
- Mongoose as ODM
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Socket.io for real-time communication

### DevOps & Tools
- Git for version control
- npm for package management

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

1. `backend/`: Contains the Node.js server code
2. `src/`: Contains the React frontend code

Key directories and files:

- `backend/`
  - `controllers/`: Business logic for different features
  - `models/`: Mongoose schemas
  - `routes/`: API route definitions
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware (e.g., authentication)
  - `server.js`: Main server file

- `src/`
  - `components/`: React components
  - `store/`: Redux store configuration and slices
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `App.tsx`: Main React component

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rideshare.git
   cd rideshare
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   \`\`\`
   npm install
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ..
   \`\`\`

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory
   - Add the following variables:
     \`\`\`
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     PORT=5000
     \`\`\`

4. Set up environment variables for the frontend:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     \`\`\`
     REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
     REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
     \`\`\`

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   \`\`\`
   cd backend
   npm start
   \`\`\`

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   \`\`\`
   npm start
   \`\`\`

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.


## Future Enhancements

- Implement real payment gateway integration
- Add user ratings and reviews
- Enhance map features with real-time driver tracking
- Implement push notifications for mobile devices
